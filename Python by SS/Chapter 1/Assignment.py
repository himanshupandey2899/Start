# Question - Take diameter as input and calculate the area of a circle

# Area of a circle = 3.14*(d/2)^2 or 3.14*r^2

d = int(input("Diameter of the circle: ")) # To take diameter of a circle

print("Diameter of the circle is: " , d) # To print diameter of a circle

r = d/2 # To calculate radius of a circle

print("Radius of the circle is: " , r) # To print radius of a circle

a = 3.14 * r ** 2 # To calculate area of a circle

print(f"Area of a circle with radius {r} and diameter {d} = {a}") # To print area of a circle
